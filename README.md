My PowerShell profile as a Windows-centric programmer and reverse engineer. See more at my [scripts](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/powershell-scripts/blob/main/Parse-Windbg-Addresses-Breakpoint.ps1).

Some invocations are built using AI instructed to follow a very well defined sequence of actions. I love using PowerShell but not writing scripts in it.
